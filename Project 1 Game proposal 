My project 1 will be a Prince trivia game

The title of the game will be: May you live 2 see the Dawn

The game will start off with the main board/page.
It will tell the player what the game is, and what to expect. 

The game will then ask the user a question about Prince. The user can choose either true or false. 
If the player gets the answer right, they get a point. If the player gets the answer wrong, they get no points. 
The first player that gets 5 points wins the game.
The computer is the other player, player 2.

My MVP Goals are to have a game that hosted on the internet with a ReadMe section.  The game will be linked to my github repo. 


My Stretch Goals are to make a 2 player game that's fun and challenging.  Making a game with a working product is a stretch goal for me.
